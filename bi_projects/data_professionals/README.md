## Problem Statement: 
The data industry lacks comprehensive insights into professional demographics, compensation trends, and workforce satisfaction metrics. This gap in understanding makes it challenging for organizations to make informed decisions about hiring, retention, and industry competitiveness.

##  Project Goal: 
To create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics from a data professional survey, providing actionable insights about industry trends, salary distributions, and workforce satisfaction levels.

## Deliverable: 
A Power BI dashboard that presents:
- Salary distribution across different data roles
- Geographic salary variations
- Programming language preferences
- Industry entry barriers
- Workforce satisfaction metrics
- Demographic information


## Technical Implementation
My final dashboard is in [datasets/professional survey.pbix](datasets/professional survey.pbix)
- **Data Visualization Tool**: Power BI
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - Bar charts for salary and programming language analysis
  - Donut chart for difficulty assessment
  - Gauge charts for satisfaction metrics
